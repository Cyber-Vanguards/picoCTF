- `#Web-Exploit`
- Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection
- `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/`
- open browser, go to url, inspect code
- 1/3 of flag `picoCTF{tru3_d3`
- go to the Debugger tab > `myjs.js` has 3/3 flag `_lucky?f10be399}`
- check the CSS file,  back in the `index.html` right click on the `mycss.css` and right click on it and Open File in Style Editor which opens a new tab `t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t`
- `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}`
